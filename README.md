# STAT170AB
  The google_rating.csv is a sample of the data we crawled from the Google Places API
## Codes
  We separate all the codes into five ipynb files. They are google_api.ipynb, yelp_clean.ipynb, data_visualization.ipynb, LDA.ipynb and machine_learning.ipynb. 
  * google_api.ipynb: contains the codes crawling the ratings and reviews of each restaurant from Google by using the Google Places API.   * yelp_clean.ipynb: contains the codes doing the data cleaning and preprocessing for the yelp dataset. 
  * data_visualization.ipynb: contains the codes of plotting data distribution and relationship between attributes and target values.
  * LDA.ipynb: contains the codes of running the text reviews into LDA model. 
  * machine_learning.ipynb:  contains all the codes running three different models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor and Gradient Boosting Regressor.
