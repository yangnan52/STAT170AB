  We separate all the codes into five ipynb files. They are google_api.ipynb, yelp_clean.ipynb, data_visualization.ipynb, LDA.ipynb and machine_learning.ipynb. The google_api.ipynb contains the codes crawling the ratings and reviews of each restaurant from Google by using the Google Places API. The data gained from the Google is clean (we only crawl what we want), so it does not involve too much data cleaning in the script. The yelp_clean.ipynb contains the codes doing the data cleaning and preprocessing for the yelp dataset. The data_visualization.ipynb contains the codes of plotting data distribution and relationship between attributes and target values. The LDA.ipynb contains the codes of running the text reviews into LDA model. It comes up with dataframe containing each restaurant having the proportion of each topic. The machine_learning contains all the codes running three different models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor and Gradient Boosting Regressor.
